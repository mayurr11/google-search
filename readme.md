# Google Search Page 🌐🔍

This project is a simple Google search page implementation with basic functionality.

## Description ℹ️

The project consists of an HTML file (`index.html`), a CSS file (`style.css`), and a JavaScript file (`app.js`). It replicates a simplified version of the Google search page with a search input field, search buttons, and a Google logo.

## Features ✨

- Users can enter a search query in the input field and click the "Google Search" button to perform a Google search.
- Alternatively, users can press the Enter key to perform the search.
- If the search input is empty, a warning message "Please write something!" is displayed below the search field.

## Usage 🚀

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/google-search-page.git
    ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the Google search page.

3. Enter a search query in the input field and click the "Google Search" button to perform a search.

## File Structure 📁
